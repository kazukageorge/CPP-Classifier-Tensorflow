# Clathrin Coated Pits Classififer using traces of Auxilin and Clathrin usng Tensorflow

This is repository has the codes used to classify the traces of auxilin and clathrin molecules thats cooperate to form a clathrin coated pits inolved in how cells eat and transport outside-the-cell material. Images were collected using a micrscope.

The goal is to minimize the time needed to classify which datasets are of interests - let the machine make the decision, and humans will check the dataset for the final opinion. 

We have about 22k samples of datasets. We divide 60% to training, 20% to validation and 20% to testing. Accuracy of >90%. 



## How to run

1. Open "Terminal"
2. type: source ~/tensorflow/venv/bin/activate
3. type: python masterscript.py
